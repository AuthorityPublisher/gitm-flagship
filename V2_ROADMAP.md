# GitM.ai v2 Roadmap: Stealing Fire + RMBC II Rewrite

**Status:** Planning
**Target:** Separate site or v2 overhaul of gitm.ai
**Last Updated:** February 8, 2026

---

## The Problem with v1

v1 is informational. It tells people what The Ghost Factory does. It lists features, stages, and pricing. It works as a brochure. But it does not CONVERT at the level Jason's story deserves.

v2 applies two frameworks to every word on the site:

1. **Stealing Fire** (Kotler/Wheal) - Narrative architecture that creates altered states in the reader
2. **RMBC II** (Stefan Georgi) - Copy that moves people from awareness to action through mechanism

The result: a site that makes people FEEL something, not just understand something.

---

## Framework 1: Stealing Fire Architecture

Four forces applied to the entire site journey:

| Force | What It Does | How GitM Uses It |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Ecstasis** | Stepping outside yourself, seeing a bigger possibility | The visitor sees their expertise deployed as a real business for the first time |
| **Communitas** | Deep group connection, shared tribe | "You are not alone. There is a tribe of different-brained builders who finish what they start." |
| **Flow State** | Friction removed, optimal performance | The 90/10 model. Ghost handles 90%. You operate in your zone of genius. |
| **Altered Traits** | Permanent transformation, not a temporary high | "I finish things now." Identity shift from dreamer to deployer. |

### Site Flow as a Stealing Fire Journey

```

## Framework 2: RMBC II Copy Pipeline

Every page goes through the full RMBC II pipeline before copy is written.

### Step 1: Research (per page)
- Target audience awareness level (Schwartz scale: Unaware through Most Aware)
- Specific objections for that page's stage in the journey
- Customer language pulled from real conversations, testimonials, and intake calls
- Competitor messaging at each stage (what are agencies, coaches, and course creators saying?)

### Step 2: Mechanism (per page)
- **UMP (Unique Mechanism of Problem):** Why are they stuck? Not a character flaw. A systems failure.
  - For exec function audience: "Your brain isn't broken. The systems designed for neurotypical people are."
  - For business owners: "You don't have a knowledge problem. You have an infrastructure gap."
  - For influencers: "You built the audience. Nobody built the revenue engine."
- **UMS (Unique Mechanism of Solution):** Why The Ghost Factory specifically?
  - The 90/10 model (no other service does this)
  - Built for exit from Day 1 (no other agency thinks this way)
  - Real deployments, real revenue, real proof (not theory)

### Step 3: Brief 2.0 (per page)
Full 25-point research brief before any copy is written. Includes:
- Audience sophistication level
- Primary emotion driving action
- One big idea for the page
- Key proof elements
- Objection handling
- Voice and tone calibration

### Step 4: Copy (A/B)
- **Version A (Control):** Stefan Georgi RMBC II structure. Always written first.
- **Version B (Variant):** Claude native style. Only after A is approved.

## Page-by-Page v2 Architecture

### 1. HOME - "The Portal" (Ecstasis Trigger)

**Current v1:** Informational hero, three pathway cards, systems gap section, deployment system overview, social proof, faith foundation, CTA.

**v2 Transformation:**

**Hero:** Opens with a scene, not a tagline. The reader sees themselves in the story.
```
"You're sitting at your desk at 2 AM. Again.

Forty-seven browser tabs. Three half-finished funnels.
A Notion graveyard of business plans that were supposed
to change everything.

You know exactly what to build. You just can't get it
out of your head and into the world.

That gap between what you know and what you've deployed
has a name. And it has a solution."
```

Then: The three pathways, but each one opens with a FEELING, not a feature.

**Visual proof strip:** Not just numbers. Screenshots, logos, faces. The Objection Box leaderboard. Revenue dashboards. Real artifacts.

**Systems Gap section:** Rewritten through UMP lens. The four failed solutions (agencies, courses, coaching, SaaS) become mini-stories the reader recognizes from their own life.

**Social proof:** Video testimonials prominent. Screenshots of real conversations (Claude/Jason as proof of the system working).

**Faith Foundation:** Stays. This is core identity. But woven into the narrative, not bolted on as a section.

---

### 2. ABOUT - "The Rebuild" (Communitas + Altered Traits)

**Current v1:** Jason's 12-beat origin story timeline.

**v2 Transformation:**

This page becomes the emotional anchor of the entire site. Jason's story is one of the most compelling founder stories in the space. v1 lists the beats. v2 TELLS the story.

**Act 1: The Fall**
- Multi-million dollar business. Gone.
- 82 hotels and Airbnbs. $1,200 left.
- Two small kids. Wife in crisis.
- Closing deals from hotel bathrooms. Toilet as chair. Sink as desk.
- This is not inspiration porn. This is the floor.

**Act 2: The Rebuilding**
- 8 years of grinding back.
- Collected $1M+ closing for other people's offers.
- Top 3 closer on a team doing $2.7M/month.
- $250K invested in self-education.
- Met The Holy Spirit in the shower. (Core identity. Not marketing.)

**Act 3: The Machine**
- Built PRM Spray for his mother in 4 weeks.
- Built Dr. Nick's entire ecosystem from scratch.
- Built RTD, TCF, Dean Chitren partnership ($380K).
- Realized: the system he built to save himself could save others.
- The Ghost Factory was not a business plan. It was a conviction.

**Visual proof throughout:**
- Photos with the artwork (Elway, Davis, Petty, Earnhardt)
- Robb Report article
- PRM product photos
- Photos with Dean Chitren, deployment partners
- Real screenshots of systems built

**Altered Traits moment:**
> "For the first time in my life, I feel like I have a chance at sustained
> success. Because I'm a very smart man that never knew I needed help for
> this and I've been white-knuckling it through my life."

---

### 3. HOW IT WORKS - "The Flow Machine" (Flow State)

**Current v1:** 8-stage system cards, full scope checklist, 90/10 split, CTA.

**v2 Transformation:**

Reframe the entire page around Flow State: "This system exists to remove every piece of friction between your expertise and revenue."

Each of the 8 stages gets:
- A before/after story from a real deployment
- The specific friction it eliminates
- A deliverable that proves it happened

The Full Scope section becomes the "overwhelm trigger" (a specific RMBC technique): show the reader the ENTIRE list of what's required, let them feel the weight of it, then reveal the 90/10 split. "That's what we handle. You handle 10%."

---

### 4. RESULTS - "The Receipts" (Ecstasis Proof)

**Current v1:** Case studies with video, proof points table, PRM section.

**v2 Transformation:**

This page becomes a GALLERY of proof. Not just text. Visual artifacts everywhere.

**Visual proof elements needed:**
- [ ] Objection Box 3 leaderboard screenshots (#1 on all three)
- [ ] Robb Report article (URL or scan)
- [ ] Photos: Jason with Elway/Davis/Petty/Earnhardt artwork
- [ ] Revenue dashboard screenshots (TCF, RTD, Dean)
- [ ] PRM product photos + Dubai photos
- [ ] Deployment website screenshots (metabolicsleep.com, rethinkdieting.org, thecleanupfirm.com, prmspray.com)
- [ ] Claude/Jason conversation screenshots (the system working in real time)
- [ ] Dr. Nick Instagram screenshot (297K)
- [ ] Email subscriber count screenshots
- [ ] Stripe payment screenshots (redacted)

Case studies stay but get Stealing Fire treatment: each one is a mini-transformation story, not a feature list.

---

### 5. SCORE - "The Mirror" (Altered Traits Trigger)

**Current v1:** 8-question quiz with immediate score.

**v2 Transformation:**

Quiz questions stay mostly the same, but the results page becomes a Stealing Fire moment:

- Score 0-20 (Critical): "You are white-knuckling it. You have been for years. And you thought that was normal."
- Score 21-40 (Vulnerable): "You have the pieces. They are not connected. The gap between what you know and what you have deployed is costing you every day."
- Score 41-60 (Developing): "You are closer than most. But 'close' in deployment means nothing. Deployed or not deployed. There is no almost."
- Score 61-80 (Strong): "Your infrastructure works. But it was built by hand. It breaks when you are not watching."
- Score 81-100 (Elite): "You do not need The Ghost Factory. But you might want a partner."

Each result includes a specific next step and a specific proof point showing someone who was at that score and what happened after deployment.

---

### 6. PARTNER - "The Tribe" (Communitas)

**Current v1:** Three partner types, application form.

**v2 Transformation:**

Lead with Communitas: "There is a tribe of builders who see the world differently. They see systems where others see chaos. They see businesses where others see ideas. They finish what they start, because they built the machine that finishes for them."

Show existing partners as proof of tribe:
- Dr. Nick (297K followers, health)
- Alan & Angie (weight loss coaching)
- Dean Chitren (high-ticket golf)
- Coach Beau
- Amber/TCF (forensic bookkeeping)

The 50/50 model positioned as radical trust: "We invest our time, our tech, and our expertise. You invest your audience and your knowledge. If it works, we both win. If it doesn't, we part as friends with real data."

---

### 7. COHORT - "The Sprint" (Flow State)

**Current v1:** $2,500 sprint description, included items, pricing.

**v2 Transformation:**

Position the 30-day sprint as a "flow state container." For 30 days, all friction is removed. You show up with your expertise. Everything else is handled.

Add: testimonials from sprint graduates (once they exist). Until then, position the sprint as "the fastest way to know if this is right for you."

---

### 8. APPLY - "The Decision" (Ecstasis)

**Current v1:** Two-track toggle, pricing tiers, form.

**v2 Transformation:**

The application page becomes the moment of Ecstasis: the reader sees their future. Not "choose a package." Instead: "This is what your deployment looks like."

Show a visual mockup of a deployed business (website, funnel, email sequence, affiliate program) and say: "This is what we build. You bring the expertise. We deploy the machine."

Then the two tracks with clear emotional hooks:
- Business Owner: "You have the money and the expertise. You need the machine."
- Influencer: "You have the audience and the credibility. You need the revenue engine."

---

### 9. THANK YOU - "The Beginning" (Altered Traits)

**Current v1:** Simple confirmation.

**v2 Transformation:**

"Something just shifted. You can feel it. You went from thinking about deploying to actually starting the process. That shift, from ideation to action, is the hardest part. You just did it."

Short. Powerful. Confirms the identity shift.

## Decision: v2 Overhaul vs. Separate Site

### Option A: v2 Overhaul of gitm.ai
- **Pro:** One URL, one brand, clean
- **Pro:** SEO continuity
- **Pro:** Faster (same infrastructure)
- **Con:** Downtime during transition

### Option B: Separate Site (e.g., ghostfactory.com or separate Vercel deploy)
- **Pro:** Can A/B test entire sites
- **Pro:** v1 stays live while v2 is built
- **Con:** DNS/domain complexity
- **Con:** Brand split

**Recommendation:** v2 overhaul on gitm.ai. Build in a `v2` branch, preview on Vercel preview URL, merge to main when ready. Zero downtime.

## Performance Golf $100K Context

Separate from v2 roadmap. Brixton (Performance Golf) is prepared to pay $100K. Once Jason provides the video transcript and Vidalytics link, we build a custom landing page.

$100K Ghost Empire package for a golf brand would likely include:
- Full Ghost deployment (8 stages)
- Multi-tier value ladder ($47, $197, $997, $5K+)
- VSL production pipeline
- Affiliate program (Partnero) with commission tiers
- 12-month scaling engagement
- Paid traffic management
- Content multiplication engine
- Exit-ready documentation
- Equity position or revenue share on top

Custom landing page for Brixton: `gitm.ai/brixton` or `gitm.ai/performance-golf`
